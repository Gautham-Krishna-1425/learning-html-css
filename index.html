            <h3><b>Puzzle:-</b></h3>
            <p>A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person's ingenuity or knowledge. In a puzzle, the solver is expected to put pieces together (or take them apart) in a logical way, in order to arrive at the correct or fun solution of the puzzle. There are different genres of puzzles, such as crossword puzzles, word-search puzzles, number puzzles, relational puzzles, and logic puzzles. The academic study of puzzles is called enigmatology.</p>
            <h3><b>History of Puzzles</b></h3>
            <p>Puzzles have been enjoyed by people of all ages and cultures for thousands of years. The earliest known puzzles were created in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The ancient Greeks, for example, created "Diabolos," a game in which players had to move a disc through a maze without it falling off the edge.
    
                In the 18th and 19th centuries, puzzles became more popular in Europe, with many new types of puzzles being developed. Wooden jigsaw puzzles, for example, were first created in the 1760s in London, England, and quickly became a popular pastime.
                
                In the 20th century, puzzles continued to evolve and new types of puzzles were invented. Crossword puzzles, for example, were first created in 1913 by Arthur Wynne and quickly became a popular form of entertainment in newspapers and magazines.</p>
            <h3><b>Puzzle solving</b></h3>
            <p>Solutions of puzzles often require the recognition of patterns and the adherence to a particular kind of ordering. People with a high level of inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving such puzzles than others. But puzzles based upon inquiry and discovery may be solved more easily by those with good deduction skills. Deductive reasoning improves with practice. Mathematical puzzles often involve BODMAS. BODMAS is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction. In certain regions, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS. It explains the order of operations to solve an expression. Some mathematical puzzles require Top to Bottom convention to avoid the ambiguity in the order of operations. It is an elegantly simple idea that relies, as sudoku does, on the requirement that numbers appear only once starting from top to bottom as coming along</p>
